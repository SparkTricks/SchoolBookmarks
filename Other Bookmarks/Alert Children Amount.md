# Alert Children Amount

## Instructions

1. If your bookmark bar is already activated, skip this step. Otherwise, press `Ctrl+Shift+B`.

2. Copy this text below:
```js
javascript:document.addEventListener('mouseover',event =>{alert(event.target.children.length)});void 1
```

3. Right click on the bookmark bar and click `Add Page`.

4. Type the name you want for the bookmark into the Name box. I'd recommend naming it `Alert Children Amount`.

5. Paste the text into the URL text bar.

6. Below the URL section, click `Main Bookmarks`.

7. Press Done.

## Tip

You **MUST** click the bookmark on the page you want the code to run on, otherwise it won't work.

## Note

You must hover over the part to get the child amount.
To get rid of the alerting, refresh the page.
