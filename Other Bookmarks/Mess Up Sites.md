# Mess Up Sites

## Instructions

1. If your bookmark bar is already activated, skip this step. Otherwise, press `Ctrl+Shift+B`.

2. Copy this text below:
```js
javascript:document.body.innerHTML += "<textarea hidden></textarea>";
```

3. Right click on the bookmark bar and click `Add Page`.

4. Type the name you want for the bookmark into the Name box. I'd recommend naming it `Site Messer-Upper`.

5. Paste the text into the URL text bar.

6. Below the URL section, click `Main Bookmarks`.

7. Press Done.

## Tip

You **MUST** click the bookmark on the page you want the site to be messed up on, otherwise it won't work.

## Note

It is meant to mess up sites. It is normal for the sites to be messed up on which you use it.
